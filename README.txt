COEN 240 - Coding Assignment 5

Run w/ Octave 4.2.1, using gnuplot to plot, MacOS X

The script which performs the PCA / displays results is in:
pca.m

This script uses bayes decision theory on a reduced dimension dataset of the
iris dataset.

The first run naively reduces the dimensions by using only the first dimension
of the iris dataset. The results are then printed.

The second run uses the first principal component using PCA. The second run has
more accurate results. The results are printed.
